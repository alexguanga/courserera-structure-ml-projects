    "- When we drive a car, we have 3 different pieces. We have a steering wheel, acceleration and brake. Thus, we have the three seperate ways to perform the task.\n",
    "- However, if we had a joystick where it controlled 2 times the steering angle + 0.9 times the speed of your car, then it would be more complicated to set the car how we would like it.\n",
